   - **Key Features:**
     - **DataFrame & Series:** Easily manipulate and analyze structured data with rows and columns.
     - **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing data, remove duplicates, and normalize data.
     - **Data Transformation:** Sort, filter, and group data for deeper insights.
     - **Merging & Joining:** Combine datasets from multiple sources using SQL-like operations.
     - **Time Series Analysis:** Handle and manipulate time series data with built-in support.
